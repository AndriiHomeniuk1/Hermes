#  IMPORTANT: Using simple functions instead of a class
#  Reason: Performance testing showed that calling class methods is ~7% slower than calling regular functions.
#  If maximum speed for order execution is required, using simple functions is preferable.
#  If code structure becomes more important in the future, switching to a class is possible, but at the cost of some performance.
