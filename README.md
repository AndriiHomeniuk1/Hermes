# Hermes — Fast & Precise Order Execution Tool for Binance Futures

**Hermes** is a minimalistic, high-performance desktop tool designed for lightning-fast order placement on **Binance Futures**.
Built as a companion app—not a replacement—for trading and charting platforms like TradingView, ATAS, Quantower, or even Binance itself,
Hermes delivers a frictionless way to execute trades in real time, with precision and speed that far surpass standard trading terminals.

## Purpose

Hermes is engineered as an **always-on, low-latency trading assistant** with a highly compact interface (just **180 pixels wide**) that sits on your screen alongside your primary charting platform.

Its core purpose is to:
- Enable **instant market order execution** with one click.
- Automatically place **stop-loss and take-profit** orders based on user-defined percentages — **immediately after the entry**, with no delay.
- Operate with a **real-time WebSocket price feed**, so the freshest price is always ready in memory — no waiting for price fetch during order placement.
- Maintain a **persistent API connection** to Binance to avoid latency caused by reconnection delays.
- Function exclusively with **Binance Futures pairs** for now, with plans to expand to spot trading.
- Provide a **clean, focused experience** for scalpers and high-frequency traders who need speed and minimal screen clutter.

In short, Hermes helps you **keep up with the market** — when every seconds matters.
